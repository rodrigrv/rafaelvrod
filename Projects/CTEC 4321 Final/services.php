			<h2>Our Services</h2>
				<p>Below are all the services we offer. Take a look!</p>
		</header>
			<h3>Grooming</h3>
				<p>Our grooming services are second to none. We offer a full grooming service that includes
            bathing, nail trimming, different styles of cuts, and ear cleaning.
            	</p>

			<h3>Boarding</h3>
				<p>Not many animal clinics offer boarding services. We can say we proudly offer boarding
                here at Old West. We have 7 large kennel areas for dogs and 5 kennels for cats.
                We offer only short-term boarding right now as space is limited. All boarding is also indoor!!
                </p>
	
    		<h3>Vaccinations</h3>
               	<p>We offer a variety of vaccinations at Old West. Some are rabies, Bordetella (kennel cough), 
                DHLPPV (Leptospirosis), leukemia, FRVCP (cat flu and respiratory infection), and others. These 
                are combined in packages under the dogs and cats section of this page.
                </p>
                
            <h3>Spay/Neuter</h3>
               	<p>As with all clinics, we offer spaying and neutering to keep the pet population
                    under control. Unlike most clinics we have competitive pricing as it varies 
                    by the pound of your dog. Our cat pricings are fixed. If you would like a quote on pricing, 
                    just ask <a href="contact.php">here</a>.
               	</p>
                
			<h3>Dentistry</h3>
            	<p>Who doesn't like a clean set of teeth? At Old West, we make sure your dog or cat has pearly 
                whites after leaving. We also offer some teething toys to make sure your pet keeps those teeth 
                nice and healthy.

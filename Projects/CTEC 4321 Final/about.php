                        basic check-up, vaccinations, and surgeries. She has 3 pets of her own: 2 cats and 1 dog.

                        <h3>Haley</h3>
                        <div class="aboutimage">
                        <img src="images/vet3small.jpg" alt="" />  
                        </div><br>
						<p>Haley has been with us since 2013. She loves animals, having 4 at home (all dogs).
                        She is not only a skilled technician, but also a certified full service groomer. It includes
                        bathing, nail trimming, and of course the haircut. She was drawn to this field because she always
                        had animals growing up.

        	<h2 class="org_title">Our History</h2>
            	<p class="org_text">In 1996, the Morningside Community encountered 
                increased unemployment rate; underemployment; lack of training amid 
                its most vulnerable populations: single parent families, and senior 
                citizens. In 1997, in response to these conditions a group of 
                Morningside residents established Morningside Neighborhood Community 
                Development Association (MNCDA) nonprofit organization.  Mildred 
                Garland & BC Foreman donated the first dollars towards MNCDA’s 
                distribution for Thanksgiving & Christmas turkeys. MNCDA continued 
                to serve & support needy families and paid utility bills for senior 
                citizens to ease financial shortfalls.
                <br><br>
                
                To evolve with the changing community: lack of 
                stability, the school dropped out rate within the Morningside 
                community’s single parent homes bolstered a significant increase. 
                Communicable disease tripled within the Morningside Community at an 
                alarming rate. MNCDA’s transformation began. 
                <br><br>
                
        		In 2014, Morningside Community Development Association 
                (MCDA) was incorporated and; 501 (c) 3 certification was established. 
                MCDA expanded programs and services to include but is not limited to 
                affordable decent housing to low income individuals and families; 
                educational enrichment programs; job readiness/placement opportunities;
                 health information & referral; outreach/prevention and transportation.

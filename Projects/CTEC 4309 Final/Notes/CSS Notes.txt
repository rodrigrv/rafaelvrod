CSS

H1 {font-style: italic; color: red}

H1 is selector

Font-style is property:value

Where to place CSS rules

Inline
- Is discouraged because it's harder to navigate and edit.
- Has highest priority.

Embedded in the document
- Within the head section.
- Apply "style" to start.
- Don't confuse head and header. Head contains all meta information and keywords.
  Header is the beginning of content in the body section.		

External CSS File
- Link is more favored over import.
- Link vs Import: Link will be rendered quick.
- @import, browser wait until all links are caught up.


Selectors
- Universal selector: *

- Type selectors: HTML element type (h1, span, p)

- Class selector: used for multiple elements. Has period (.)

- ID selector: used for only 1 element. Has asterisk (#)

- Combinators: combines multiple selectors.
	- Descendent combinator	
		- Everything is separated by space.
		- (Ex. div.main ul li b {font-size: 12px}
		- As long as your included inside the div.

	- Child combinator
		- Selecting children only.	
		- Only selects the children and not grandchildren.
		- No need to add HTML code to add class attribute.

	- Sibing combinator
	
- Attribute selectors:
- Pseudo-selectors:
- Pseudo-class:
	- a:link
	- a:visited
	- a:hover
	- a:active

	-:focus
	-:first-child
	-:last-child
	-:nth-child(n)
	-:first-of-type
	-:last-of-type
	-:nth-of-type(n) (can select whatever number of paragraph)

Determining the Cascade Order
	!important
		-Ex. body {color: black !important;}
	Inline > embedded > imported
	Specificity: rules with more points win
		-HTML selector: 1 pt
		-Class: 10 pt
		-ID: 100 pt
		Ex.. main ul li b {...} 13 pts
	Last one wins
	Inherited properties apply unless overridden

Style Sheet strategies
	Use external CSS if possible
	Have a global.css for default styles of your site

CSS Element Control
	Margin - spacing between elements

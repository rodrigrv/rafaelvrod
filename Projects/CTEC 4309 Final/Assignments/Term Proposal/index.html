						<h2 align="middle">Revenue Models</h2>
                        <br>
						<h3>Geographic Targeting </h3> – is especially powerful for smaller businesses that would like to capitalize on the local searches for products and services. DMA areas, area codes, time zones, GPS coordinates and IP protocols provide some geo targeting capability and allow marketers maximize the reach.  In addition, it can always bring additional sales to the brick-and-mortar store if you send your shoppers to the nearest location to pick up the purchase.
						<br>
						<br>
						<h3>Affinity Targeting</h3> – refers to reaching customers on their favorite sites (usually related to hobbies and interests) that they heavily visit and interact with. Those users spend more time online (on those sites), are more favorable to the site content and ads and purchase faster and easier. If you like one site that you visit daily, you are more open to digest the message in the ads and in fact act on it. Works every time.  Affinity targeting especially works for brand evangelism.

						<h2>SWOT</h2>
                        
                        <p text align="left">
                       Strengths: Sam's All Pets Animal Clinic offers such a wide variety of services that the customer base has unlimited growth potential as well returning revenue. 
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Weaknesses: Seasonal changes, weather and various conditions could potentially jeopardize opportunites pending or confirmed. Sam's All Pet's Animal Clinic is limited by space and can only enterain clients on a first come first serve, basis. 
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Opportunities: Because of the varied client base as well as the size, many opportunites lie in the potential to cash in on the value of this data. By allowing access to customer data potential affiliates can gain access to a targeted market.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Threats: Location is a major threat. Any competitor with a local site or even multiple sites within a similar pricing bracket could potentially be a major threat to the business. 
                       <br>

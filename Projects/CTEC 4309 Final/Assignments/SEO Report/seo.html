    <h2>Organic Ranking of Search Results</h2>
        	<ol>
            	<li>Content</li>
                	<p>Search engines reward websites that contain fresh, current, compelling, and unique content. Adding a blog to your website is one of the best ways to get your website found in the organic search results.</p>
                <li>Inbound Links</li>
                	<p>Search engines pay considerable attention to whether or not other authoritative websites are linking back to yours. If an authoritative website in your industry is linking back to content found on your website, that’s a good indication that your website is relevant</p>
                <li>Activity</li>
                	<p>Search engines consider the number of visitors to your website, the amount of time they spend, the number of pages they visit, where they click, and where they came from, to be additional measures of your website’s relevance. One of the best ways to get people to your website is by providing them with useful information they need.</p>
                <li>Popularity and Social Sharing</li>
                	<p>Search engines are increasingly taking into account whether or not websites are popular. Your presence on social media, whether or not you’ve published videos, the existence of online reviews all of these previously ignored metrics are now being considered by the search engines.</p>

    <!-- Keywords -->
                
    <h2>Keywords and Current Ranking</h2>
    	<p>The keywords suggested for our client "Driver's Edge" are:</p>
        	<ul>
            	<li>Auto repair, Grapevine Texas</li>
                	<p>This is most common search word for people with broken car and when they do not know an auto repair place. They search it with auto repair in that city. Based on this search keyword, our client’s website appears on 1st page and 5th tab from the top on Google search and on the 3rd page and 3rd tab for Bing search.</p>
                <li>Oil change, Grapevine Texas</li>
                <p>For people looking for oil changes at a reasonable price, this is a go to keyword that customers will likely put in. Since the oil change is recommended to be changed at or around 3000 miles or every 3 months, this will be a frequent search for customers. For Google search it's on the 4th page and 7th tab down. Bing search yields the 6th page and the 13th tab down.</p>
                <li>Auto repair deals, Grapevine Texas</li>
                	<p>Our client offer deals and specials on oil change, alignment, brakes and other repairs based on the total cost. This could a good keyword for search when people are looking for good deals. This shows up on the 3rd page and 5th tab from the top on Google search and the 7th page and 13th tab down.</p>
            </ul>
		<p>The key words that our client needs to focus on are those key words that our competitors are using.

    <!-- Analysis -->
    
    <h2>Analysis of Current Web site</h2>
    	<p>After analyzing the clients web site, most of what is currently there is great for organic search. It's a hard job trying to get an auto repair shop on the 1st page, much less on the 1st tab of the search results with so many little shops out there trying to get on the web. As far as the website itself, the content was there as well as great usability. The landing page was nice, clean, and consistent. There were however, one or two things that could be improved on.</p>
        <p class="analysis_problem">The first thing that we saw is that their focus was on particular locations for their keyword searches. A new focus could be on the quality aspect. A more refined keyword to replace the location based search result could be "great auto repair" as an example.</p>
        <p class="analysis_problem">Another problem that was apparent to us was the services that were offered at the bottom of the screen. We know that usability and aesthetics are at play here, but when it comes to content, it's important to know where it needs to go. There could have been a completely separate tab listing the services offered at various location. There was no need to place it at the bottom of the page.</p><a href="#top">Back to top</a>

        <p>Search engines look for two criteria when evaluating your website links and determining your website ranking: quantity and quality. That means both the number and the relevance of your links are crucial for getting your website found faster by search engines, and by potential clients. We need to improve our inbounds links based on both the factors of quality and quantity of inbound link.</p>
